# Bay-Wheels-Rides-Analysis
Analysis of Bike Sharing Rides with Bay Wheels Data provided by Lyft.
Bay Wheels is a bike sharing service available throughout Bay Area of west coast USA. It is a affordible and accessible way of transportation.  Bay Wheels system currently has over 2,600 bicycles in 262 stations across San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose. Rides are available to people through Bay Wheels subscription and Lyft app.

In this analysis I compared how trends of peolple using bike sharing service differ among three main cities: San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland. The project demonstrates exploratory visualizations for analysis and explanatory data visualizations for presentation. 

# Structure of dataset.
The Bay Wheels trip history data was presented in multiple zip folders for each month of the year starting from 2017 through July 2019. After collecting and combining all of the bike trip data avalable I have a dataset containing over 3 million entries (rows) and 17 colunmns. Original columns of dataset include following:
- Trip Duration (seconds)
- Start Time and Date
- End Time and Date
